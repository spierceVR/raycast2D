# raycast2D
A raycasted scene in purely vanilla JavaScript.
- Inspired by [The Coding Train's p5.js 2D Raycasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo) and Wolfenstein

- WASD controls the camera movement
- Sliders allow user to see the effect of changing the camera's FOV, ray length, and ray count
- Barriers are randomly generated on page load, so refreshing the page will yield a different scene each time.
